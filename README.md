# Mobile Flashcards Project

This app has been built using Expo. I have added Typescript to help during development so that issues could be detected quickly, providing a great development experience.

To run the App it should be enough to call "yarn install && expo start" (or "npm install && npm run start").

App has been tested using Expo Go app on a Xiaomi Mi6 (Android) & on an iPhone 8.
